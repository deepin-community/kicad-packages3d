 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
       wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
     for the public:

     Copyright and Similar Rights.
 e.  Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
     of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
     obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
     December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
 f.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
     exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
     Your use of the Licensed Material.
 g.  License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a

     world.
 m.  You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under

 .
 Section 2 – Scope.
 .
 a.  License grant.
     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
        Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
        and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply,
        and you do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
        authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
        whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
        modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
        to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
        modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
        Measures.  For purposes of this Public License, simply making
        modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
        Material.
     5. Downstream recipients.
         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
            Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
            to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
            this Public License.
         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every
            recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
            offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
            Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You
            apply.
         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
            additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
            Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
            so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of
            the Licensed Material.
     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
        use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
        endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
        designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
 b.  Other rights.
     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
        this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
        waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor
        to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
        Rights, but not otherwise.
     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
        royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
        directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
        waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
        the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

     2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the

     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
     Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

        the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible
        License.
     2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
        License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable

     3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
        conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
        Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the

 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
 Your use of the Licensed Material:
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database;
 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
    in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
    contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
    and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
    Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
    includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
    known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
 b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
    for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
    exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
    this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
    has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
    damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in
    part, this limitation may not apply to You.
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
    closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
    Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
    License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate

    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
       cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
    the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.
 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the

    be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
    of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission
    under this Public License.
 b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
    shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
    enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
 c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
    to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

    limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
    the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
    or authority.
